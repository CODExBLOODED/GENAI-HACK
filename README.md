## How To Start The Application
- For demonstration purposes, install NPM, Google CLI (for the API key to work), Python 3.9.0, and PIP 24.0.
- To run the demonstration, type ``npm i`` in a command window to install dependencies in the ``front`` directory, and then type ``npm start`` to open the application.
- For any use case, the only prerequisite is an Android OS version 5.0 or later smart device. Laptops and desktop computers also work.
- Enjoy!
